This repository represents the T-SQL code written during the implementation phase of a group project in which we, as a group, researched, designed, and implemented a relational database management system based on the Tesco UK e-commerce platform.

Thanks to [Dr. Carolyn Begg](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Database-Systems-Practical-Implementation-Management/dp/1292061189) for her expert guidance throughout the project and for the following remarks:

> "Excellent coursework. Perhaps the high complexity of the case study (which was very well done) affected the time left to complete the final sections. 85/100"
