# Database Applications: Coursework

> _A study and implementaion of an e-commerce RDBMS by [M. Crabtree](https://github.com/mj-crabtree), [A. Jack](https://github.com/aldojack), and [M. Hobot](https://github.com/HobotM) in pursuit of COMP09050 @ UWS 21/22_

This repository represents the T-SQL code written during the implementation phase of a group project in which we, as a group, researched, designed, and implemented a relational database management system based on the Tesco UK e-commerce platform.

> "Excellent coursework. Perhaps the high complexity of the case study (which was very well done) affected the time left to complete the final sections. 85/100"
